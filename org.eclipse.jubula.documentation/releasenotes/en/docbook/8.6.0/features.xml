    <para>
        We added the possibility to search for places where a given cell in a Central Test
        Data is referenced through the <emphasis role="strong">?getCentralTestDataValue</emphasis>
        function. The results are classified as being exact (when the exact cell is referenced) and
        approximate (when the column of the cell is referenced). Please note that only the literal
        references are found (e.g. those which do not use parameters, variables or other function calls).

    <para>
        It is now possible to check if an AUT is startable directly from the AUT Config Dialog.
        You can use the <literal>Try AUT</literal> button for this. When clicked, the ITE tries to
        start the AUT (if the ITE is already connected to an AUT Agent, that is used, otherwise
        the embedded Agent is started). In case of a successful AUT start, the AUT is kept running,
        otherwise the user is notified of the reasons why starting the AUT failed.

      We added a new navigation feature. Jubula now maintains a history of visited Editors, and it is possible
      to navigate between these, or only those which have been edited.
