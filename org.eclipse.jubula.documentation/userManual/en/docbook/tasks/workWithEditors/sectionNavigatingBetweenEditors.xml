  <title>Navigating between Editors</title>
  <para>
    Double clicking a Test Case Editor root node helps in navigating to a Test Suite or Test Case
    referencing the edited Test Case: 
  </para>
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        If there is a single Editor open which references the Test Case, that Editor is activated.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        If there are more than one such Editors open, then a dialog pops where you can choose
        which one to activate.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        If there are no Editors referencing the Test Case, then the list of Test Suites and Test Cases
        referencing the given Test Case is shown, and you can choose one to open its Editor.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
    <para>
      Jubula maintains a list of all previously visited Editors, and it is possible to navigate between
      them using the <literal>Previous / Next Editor</literal> toolbar items. The default shortkeys for these
      are <emphasis role="input">Ctrl + Left</emphasis> and <emphasis role="input">Ctrl + Right</emphasis>, respectively.
      There are also two similar toolbar items, <literal>Previous / Next Edited Editors</literal> which navigate between
      those Editors which have been edited.
    </para>
